# Task Title: Queue

# Task Description: 
write a generic Queue class. A Queue is a FIFO data structure
(first in, first out). The Queue class should work with generics, e.g., Queue<String>
stringQueue = new Queue<String>();

Implement the following generic methods:

• the enqueue method puts an object (parameter) at the end (tail) of the of our
Queue.

• the dequeue method removes the first object (head) from our Queue.

• The head method returns a reference to the head element (the oldest element in
the Queue), but this object remains in the Queue

• The tail method returns a reference to the tail element (the newest element in
the Queue), but this object remains in the Queue
Write a test class with a main method. Create two different Queues – one for Strings
and one for Integers. Test all the methods with some test objects.
